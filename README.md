# ORD-Planes
JavaScript/HTML game in which the player catches falling objects to score points.  This is a light-weight game built for young players.

I've published a GitHub repository for this game.  Here is the link:  https://github.com/jordanhowe25/Luggage-Catcher ...  I've started some of the basic work and setting up the layout.  This game was created Jordan Howe, Lucas Gruber, Gonzalo Montoya, and Richard Lara.  We are students at DeVry University and produced this game as part of our Senior Project.  The game was created for our partners at O'Hare airport and the Chicago Department of Avation and is intended to be published on their Fly with Butch Game Center at http://www.flywithbutchohare.com/.  

Description:  The game is intended for younger kids and is a "catch the falling objects" type game where the player is trying to catch as much luggage as possible in a 3 minute time period.  There are no obstacles or negative consequences in this game as it was intended for younger kids.  It is designed to be played on a 1920x1080 game area and at full screen as this will be the game environment that it will be played on at O'Hare airport.  Simply touch or click the MOVE buttons in game to much the luggage collector left and right.  Butch's plane will be dropping luggage out of his plane at random intervals and the luggage will be falling at random speeds (within a set range).  The game was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery.
